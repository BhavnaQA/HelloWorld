Babel is for backward compatibility from ES6 to non ES6 

to install babel 
    npm i @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/node @babel/preset-env
    then create .babelrc file in the root directory of the project


to run ./node_modules/.bin/babel newfeatures.js ---> converts .js file to older verion 

./node_modules/.bin/babel newfeature.js -o old.js --> save it into old.js 


instead to doing the above 2 commands and converting it into old file in line 8 n 10 we use 
 ./node_modules/.bin/babel-node newfeatures.js  this is new feature of babel and in this converting to old version is done internally 


Only I default export
For default export no need to having the same name while importing
for default export while importing we shouldn't specify curly braces
