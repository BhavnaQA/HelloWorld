In array's if we do arr1 = arr2 then array 2 points to the same location as arr1 and 
therefore any changes to arr1 will reflect in arr2. To clone the original state and not
 to reflect the new changes we use spread operator



Spread Operator

 To copy
    let arr1 = [1,2,3]
    let arr2 = [...arr1,5,6,7,8]
To clone
    let arr1 = [1,2,3]
    let arr2 = [...arr1]
