Objects are variables that contain manu values and can be compared to objects in real like. Each value of an object is a 
    key:value pairs seperated by commas

    let person = {
        name: 'John',
        age: 20,
        email: 'test@test.com
    }

    let name = 'John'
    let age = 20

We can access the value in the object using its key property.

let person = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 20
}

console.log(person.name)


we can use const person ={
    // constant won't allow to reassign values
}


you can nest objects too

let person = {
    name: 'John',
    car: {
        make: 'honda'
    }
}

Methods can be in objects too
