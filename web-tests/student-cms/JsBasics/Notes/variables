JS is called Dynamically Typed Language i.e variable type can be changed Dynamically.

***********************************

6 primitive Datatypes
    string
    number
    bigint
    boolean
    undefined
    symbols
    null ( for objects)

to find the datatype use keyword typeof
    console.log(typeof <variable>)

**************************


Scope of Variables are Global or Local

if we give a variable in a function and does not define it then ir is taken as Global variable

function test(num1, num2){
    sum = num1+num2 // here sum is a Global variable
    let sum2 = num1 + num2 // here because inside the fucntion we defined it therefore the scope is local
}
