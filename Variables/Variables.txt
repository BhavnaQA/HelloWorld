JS is dynamically typed lang, variables do not require explicit declaration.
    Example: let name = 'Bhavna'
    let allows change in value of variables
        let name = 'Aadi'

    const is Constant which does not allow change in value of variable.
        const name = 'Ruby'
        const name = 'Gem' this will throw error

Primitive Datatypes in JS :string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, symbols
null is also used but for Objects

let name = 'John' #string
let day = 25 #number
let isSunday = true #boolean
let undef; # undefined
let noVal = null # null

let bigInt = 900073873e8937893279827982789n #bigint
let symbol = Symbol('sym') # Symbol


to know a type of variable
console.log(typeof <variable name>);
